Concept model of a bar network

Bar: a place, where you can take some cocktails and have your free time.
The Bar always has a Name (data type = text) and Wifi (data type = boolean value), it follows that not every bar has wi-fi.
Connections:
-> Bar (1…*) — has — (1…1) Menu 
Each bar can have only one Menu, but one Menu can be in several bars. 

-> Bar (1…*) — located — (1…1) Address
The bar has at least one address or more. Every address is unique for each bar.

-> Bar (1…1) — equipped — (0…1) Garden
The bar can have a garden, but it’s not necessary. 

-> Bar (0…*) — visits — (0…*) Client
The bar can have clients. 

-> Bar (1…1) — works — (0…*) Employee
The bar hires employees. Each employee must work in a certain bar. 


Menu: a list with drinks which are in the repertoire of the bar.

Connections:
-> Menu (0…*) — has — (0…*) Drink
The menu can have an unlimited number of drinks. Also, drinks can be in several menus.

Drink: it's a drink, which you can order from Menu.
Each drink has a specific Name (data type = text), Percentage — percent of alcohol (data type = number between 0 and 1, where 0 means no alcohol and 1 means 100% alcohol) and a type.

Type: it's a type of a Drink such as “long drink”, “shots” atd., which you can find in the menu. Every type has its Name (data type = text) and Size in ml (data type = number). 

Connections:
-> Drink (0…*) — typed — (1…1) Type
Each drink has a type. There can be several drinks of the same type.


Address: a mandatory information about each bar. This information includes the Country (data type = text), where the bar is located, City (data type = text), Street (data type = text), HouseNumber (data type = number) and PostCode (data type = number).

Terrace: the bar may have an additional area - Terrace. It has an attribute Open (data type = boolean value), which means, that the terrace can be covered by canopies or not.
Also, each Terrace has different Size (data type = number) in square meters.


Inheritance connections:
-> Client — Person
-> Employee — Person

Now all clients and employees are people. They have specific GivenName (data type = text), FamilyName (data type = text), Phone number (data type = text), which isn’t necessary, and an Age (data type = number).
Also, each employee has his own working Title (data type = text) and a certain Wage (data type = number) crown per hour. 

Employee: is a person, who works in the bar.

Client: is a Person, who visits the bar.
